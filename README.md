Read and write vaccine records on NFC tag

This CRUD Arduino program stores vaccination information on NFC chips using the Adafruit [PN532 NFC/RFID Controller Shield](https://www.adafruit.com/product/789). I built this for [Khushi Baby](http://www.khushibaby.org/) in our first few weeks of prototyping. Because we were designing a mHealth system for resource-poor settings, we considered  using a  feature phone with a NFC reader instead of a smartphone. We eventually went with the smartphone, but not before I learned some Arduino!
